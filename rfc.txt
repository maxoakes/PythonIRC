9. Security Considerations 
 
Messages sent using this system have no protection against inspection, tampering or outright forgery. The server sees all messages that are sent through the use of this service. 'Private' messaging may be easily intercepted by a 3rd party that is able to capture network traffic. Users wishing to use this system for secure communication should use/implement their own user-to-user encryption protocol.  
 
10. IANA Considerations 
 
None 
 
10.1. Normative References
